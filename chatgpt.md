# ChatGPT Coding Diary

## Project Name: _Rhythm Game_

### Date: _11/22/24_

## 1. **Task/Problem Description**

Briefly describe the problem you're trying to solve or the task you're working on.

`I'm trying to make a sign up and log in system using json files and pygame `

---

## 2. **Initial Approach/Code**

Describe the initial approach you took to solving the problem. If you started writing code, include it here.

```
1. Have 'log in' and 'sign up' as big text near the top.
2. Make button - Get the rectangles that surrounds the texts in step 1 and make it so if there's a click on the rectangle, it does something. (pygame buttons are weird)
3. If logging in, look through the json file to see if the username and password is there.
4. If signing up, write the data to a json file.

```

- What was your plan for solving the problem?
- Did you have any initial thoughts or strategies before using ChatGPT?

---

## 3. **Interaction with ChatGPT**

### Questions/Requests to ChatGPT
Write down the questions or requests you made to ChatGPT. 
Also include what code from ChatGPT you are unsure of and craft a question that asks for further clarification. 

```text
# Example prompt to ChatGPT:
How can I optimize this sorting function for large datasets?
```

---

## 4. **ChatGPT's Suggestions/Code Changes**

Record the code or suggestions ChatGPT provided. Include any changes or improvements ChatGPT suggested and how it influenced your approach.

```python
# ChatGPT suggested using a custom sorting algorithm to improve efficiency
def optimized_sort(numbers):
    # Implementation of a more efficient sorting algorithm
    pass
```

- What was ChatGPT's solution or suggestion?
- How did it differ from your original approach?

---

## 5. **Reflection on Changes**

Reflect on the changes made to your code after ChatGPT's suggestions. Answer the following questions:

- Why do you think ChatGPT's suggestions are helpful or relevant?
- Did the suggestions improve your code? How?
- Did you understand why the changes were made, or are you still uncertain about some parts?

Example:
> ChatGPT recommended using a more efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort. I think this will improve the runtime for large inputs, but I need to review the algorithm's complexity to fully understand its advantages.

---

## 6. **Testing and Results**

After making the changes, did you test your code? What were the results?

- Did you run any tests (e.g., unit tests, edge cases)?
- Did the code work as expected after incorporating ChatGPT's changes?

```python
# Example: Testing the updated sorting function
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1]
print(optimized_sort(numbers))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 5, 9]
```

- Did you encounter any bugs or issues during testing?

## 7. **What Did You Learn?**

In this section, reflect on what you learned from this coding session. Did you gain any new insights, or were there areas you still struggled with?
